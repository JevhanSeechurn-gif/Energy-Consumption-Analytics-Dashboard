# UK Electricity Demand Analytics Dashboard
---

## Project Overview

This is a analytical dashboard that explores historical electrcity demands throughout Great Britain from 2015 to 2025, as well comparing future scenarios with National Grid ESO. The project consists of data processing, interactive visualisations, KPI analysis and machine-learning demand forecast, with resutls displayed via streamlit, tableau and Power BI.

## Data Sources

| Dataset | Source | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| Historical Electricity Demand | National Grid ESO / NESO | 2015–2025 |
| Future Energy Scenarios 2023 | National Grid ESO | Forecasts to 2050 |
| Future Energy Scenarios 2024 | National Grid ESO | Forecasts to 2050 |

## Database Schema

```The dataset is structured in a tabular format, with each row representing energy consumption by source and year. Key fields include:

Year
Energy Source (e.g. fossil fuels, nuclear, renewables)
Consumption Value (e.g. TWh or %)

This structure enables straightforward time-series analysis and comparison across energy types.
